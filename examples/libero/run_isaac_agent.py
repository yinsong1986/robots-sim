"""LIBERO on Isaac Sim, driven by a Strands ``Agent`` in natural language.

Companion to ``run_mujoco_agent.py``: same prompt-to-tool-pick agent
shape, same one-shot ``evaluate_benchmark`` invocation, same GR00T
container lifecycle. Differs in backend choice
(``IsaacSimulation``) and the tool-wrapping shape: where the MuJoCo
file passes the ``Simulation`` instance directly to ``Agent(tools=...)``
because ``MuJoCoSimEngine`` inherits from ``AgentTool`` and exposes
its 64-action enum, this Isaac file wraps :meth:`IsaacSimulation.evaluate_benchmark`
in a single ``@tool``-decorated function and passes that to the agent.

Status (as of 2026-06)
----------------------
Target runtime is the Isaac Sim 6.0 NGC docker image
(``nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:6.0``, Python 3.12, RTX/L4 GPU, headless),
matching the ``isaacsim>=6.0`` / ``requires-python>=3.12`` migration.
The end-to-end lifecycle was previously validated on the Isaac Sim 4.5
image (``nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:4.5.0``); the dual-path
``isaacsim.*`` / ``omni.isaac.*`` imports keep the same code path
working on both. The script
runs past ``IsaacSimulation.is_available`` → ``create_world`` →
``add_robot`` (real Franka USD over the Omniverse CDN) → ``add_camera``,
and the agent invokes ``evaluate_isaac_benchmark`` on a one-tool
surface.

LIBERO benchmark on Isaac is NOT yet runnable end-to-end
--------------------------------------------------------
The agent's ``evaluate_isaac_benchmark`` tool call routes through the
same ``IsaacSimulation.evaluate_benchmark`` path as ``run_isaac.py``,
so it runs the same way: ``LiberoAdapter.on_episode_start`` calls
``sim.load_scene(...)`` and ``IsaacSimulation.load_scene`` now realizes
the LIBERO/BDDL-compiled MJCF as USD prims on the Isaac stage (the
substantive LIBERO-on-Isaac work -- implemented in
`#129 <https://github.com/strands-labs/robots-sim/issues/129>`_, which
superseded the fail-fast stub PR #117 shipped for the closed #116). The
eval completes end-to-end; the agent surfaces the ``success_rate`` in
its summary, and this script **exits non-zero** only on a genuine eval
error (the ``__main__`` guard forces ``os._exit(1)`` so Isaac's
SimulationApp fast-shutdown can't swallow a failure into exit 0). A
*meaningful* (non-zero) ``success_rate`` also needs the articulation
fix (#123). Use ``examples/libero/run_mujoco_agent.py`` for the
CPU-friendly reference path, or drive the Isaac backend directly via
the manual ``create_world`` -> ``add_robot`` -> ``add_object`` ->
``add_camera``
-> ``step`` -> ``render`` quickstart in ``docs/index.md`` (which works
end-to-end on Isaac Sim 6.0).

The earlier ``--policy=groot`` ``success_rate=0.0`` warning predates
PRs `#61 <https://github.com/strands-labs/robots-sim/pull/61>`_ /
`#70 <https://github.com/strands-labs/robots-sim/pull/70>`_ landing the
camera + Articulation Phase-2 wiring; with both merged on ``main``,
the procedural / real-asset robot load + camera frames are now wired
correctly. End-to-end ``--policy=groot`` numbers still need a host
that satisfies all of: Isaac Sim 6.0+, libero (BDDL files),
``strands-robots`` under Isaac's Python (#71), and a GR00T inference
container.

Why a single-tool wrapper instead of full enum
-----------------------------------------------
``run_mujoco_agent.py``'s preamble notes that earlier sessions
"reduced the agent's tool surface from the full 64-action ``Simulation``
enum to a single wrapper" and judged that **worse** for MuJoCo
because: (a) MuJoCo already has the AgentTool wiring, (b) the full
enum exercises the natural-language → action-pick → kwarg-fill flow
the agent demo is meant to showcase. The Isaac case is different:

- ``IsaacSimulation`` does NOT yet inherit ``AgentTool``; it extends
  the ``SimEngine`` ABC alone. Wiring it up to mirror MuJoCo's
  ``MuJoCoSimEngine(PhysicsMixin, RenderingMixin, RecordingMixin,
  RandomizationMixin, SimEngine, AgentTool)`` is its own (substantial)
  refactor on `#14 <https://github.com/strands-labs/robots-sim/issues/14>`_'s
  Phase 3 list.
- Until that refactor lands, the only way to give the agent a tool
  is the ``@tool`` decorator on a hand-written wrapper. The wrapper
  necessarily collapses the full surface -- the ``Simulation`` tool's
  64-action JSON enum has no ``IsaacSimulation`` equivalent yet.

So the agent here picks ``evaluate_isaac_benchmark`` from a 1-tool
surface, fills its kwargs from prompt context, runs, and summarises.
The agent demo still exercises the prompt → tool-call → kwarg-fill
path; it's just a degenerate "1-of-1 pick". Once the Isaac AgentTool
wrapper exists in either ``strands-robots-sim`` or ``strands-robots``,
this file should be migrated to the full-enum shape (single-line
diff: drop ``@tool`` wrapper + change ``Agent(tools=[...])`` arg) so
the agent regains the natural-language action-pick demo value.

What the script handles deterministically (NOT the agent)
---------------------------------------------------------
Same partition as ``run_mujoco_agent.py``. The agent owns ONE
decision (invoking ``evaluate_isaac_benchmark`` with kwargs filled
from prompt context); the script owns:

* ``is_available()`` short-circuit on a non-Isaac host -- the cheap
  ``importlib.util.find_spec("omni.isaac.kit") | find_spec("isaacsim")``
  probe runs before the GR00T container side effects so a misconfigured
  matrix run exits with a structured ``RuntimeError`` rather than wasting
  30 s on a docker pull.
* GR00T inference container lifecycle (start, wait-for-load, teardown
  on exit) via ``gr00t_inference(action='lifecycle', ...)`` -- same
  block as ``run_mujoco_agent.py``, container name defaulted to
  ``gr00t-libero-isaac`` so Isaac and MuJoCo eval runs don't collide
  on the same host.
* Procedural Panda + RTX camera setup. Isaac doesn't auto-attach
  viewport cameras the way MuJoCo's ``mjData`` does, so the camera
  prim has to land on the stage before any ``render`` / recorder
  pulls from it.
* Rollout-video MP4 recording, at parity with
  ``run_mujoco_agent.py``: the script arms
  ``IsaacSimulation.start_cameras_recording`` before the agent runs and
  flushes via ``stop_cameras_recording`` after. Because Isaac's RTX
  renderer is thread-bound, capture is synchronous -- the recorder's
  ``on_frame`` closure (stashed at module scope so it can cross the
  ``@tool`` boundary) is threaded into ``evaluate_benchmark`` and grabs
  one ``render()`` frame per control step on the eval thread. Produces a
  real ``rollouts/<date>/{rec_name}__image.mp4``. See
  strands-labs/robots-sim#112.

Owned by the agent: the single ``evaluate_isaac_benchmark(...)`` call
with ``benchmark_name`` + ``n_episodes`` + ``seed`` + ``policy_provider`` +
``policy_config`` filled from natural language, plus the natural-language
summary at the end.

Usage
-----
::

    # 1) Smoke test (mock policy; no GPU / Docker needed beyond Isaac
    #    Sim itself):
    python examples/libero/run_isaac_agent.py --policy mock --n-episodes 5

    # 2) Real run against `nvidia/GR00T-N1.7-LIBERO`. Script auto-
    #    orchestrates the GR00T inference container (idempotent). Pre-
    #    condition: HF token at `~/.cache/huggingface/token` (gated
    #    Cosmos-Reason2-2B backbone) + Docker + an NVIDIA GPU + Isaac
    #    Sim 6.0+ installed.
    python examples/libero/run_isaac_agent.py --policy groot --port 8000 --n-episodes 5

Requires
--------
- ``pip install 'strands-robots-sim[isaac]' 'strands-robots[benchmark-libero]' strands-agents``
- A configured LLM provider for Strands. Default is Anthropic Claude
  via AWS Bedrock -- see https://strandsagents.com/ for setup. Without
  one the ``Agent(...)`` call below raises an authentication /
  configuration error pointing at the SDK setup docs.
- Isaac Sim 6.0+ installed via Omniverse Launcher / Isaac Lab / NGC
  Docker image (Python 3.12). Pure-Python ``pip install`` doesn't suffice.
- For ``--policy=groot``: Docker + an NVIDIA GPU + ~30 GB free disk
  for the GR00T checkpoint (cached across re-runs).

Notes
-----
- Output is non-deterministic by design (LLM-generated summary); the
  R15 backend matrix consumes ``run_isaac.py`` (sibling file) for
  grep-stable numbers.
- Rollout video is recorded via the synchronous Isaac recorder (one
  ``render()`` frame per control step), producing a real
  ``rollouts/<date>/{rec_name}__image.mp4`` at parity with the MuJoCo
  agent.
