"""Motion planning for the SO-101 pick-and-place demo (issue #67).

Two planners, one interface — both emit a backend-agnostic
:class:`JointTrajectory` (a list of joint-target waypoints) that the collector
streams via ``send_action``:

* :class:`CuroboMotionPlanner` — the real, collision-aware path (issue #67
  T4/T5). It **lazy-imports cuRobo**; cuRobo isn't installed on most boxes (and
  the latest release wants driver >= 580 vs our 550), so every entry point
  raises a clear, actionable install hint rather than a cryptic ImportError.
* :class:`ScriptedPlanner` — the dependency-free fallback (#67 graceful
  degradation). It interpolates a joint-space pick -> lift -> place -> release
  demonstration so the planning + collection loop is fully demonstrable on the
  MuJoCo backend today, without cuRobo/IK.

:func:`make_planner` returns cuRobo when available, else the scripted planner.
