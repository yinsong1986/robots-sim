"""Scene factory for the SO-101 cuRobo synthetic-data demo (issue #67).

Builds a tabletop pick-and-place world: an SO-101 6-DoF arm, a small red cube
to grasp, a "bin" placement target, and a camera trio. The demo is
**backend-agnostic** by design (the executor/collector speak the ``SimEngine``
surface), but today the only runtime present on most boxes is the **MuJoCo**
backend, which already loads a real SO-101. :func:`make_sim` returns a MuJoCo
``Simulation`` by default and lazily attempts the Isaac backend when requested
(``create_simulation("isaac")``), degrading with a clear message if the Isaac
Sim runtime isn't installed.

See ``README.md`` for how this maps onto the issue's T1-T10 task breakdown.
