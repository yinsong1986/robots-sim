"""LeRobot data collection for the SO-101 cuRobo demo (issue #67 T7).

Streams a planned :class:`~examples.so101_curobo.planner.JointTrajectory` into
the simulation (``send_action`` per waypoint) while recording each control step
as a LeRobot frame (state + action + camera images) via the tested
``strands_robots.dataset_recorder.DatasetRecorder``. Writes a v3.0 LeRobot
dataset (parquet + per-camera video), with a programmatic success check and a
resumable multi-episode loop over (optionally) randomized scenes.

Validated recipe (matches ``Simulation.stop_recording``):
    create() -> add_frame()* -> save_episode() -> finalize()
then reload locally with ``load_lerobot_episode`` (no Hub round-trip).
