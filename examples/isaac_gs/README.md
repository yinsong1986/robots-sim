# Isaac Sim + 3D Gaussian Splatting hybrid render — strands-robots-sim example

The Isaac-Sim companion to [`examples/mujoco_gs`](../mujoco_gs/). Same core
idea — a simulated robot composited against a photoreal 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) background with per-pixel, depth-aware occlusion — but with a
**deliberately different motivation**.

## Why this exists (and how it differs from `mujoco_gs`)

`mujoco_gs` exists because MuJoCo's renderer **isn't** photoreal, so it
composites the robot against a 3DGS scene to *gain* photorealism.

Isaac Sim's RTX renderer is **already** photoreal. So this example isn't about
fixing a renderer — it's about the **digital-twin / real2sim** use case:

> Drop an RTX-rendered **simulated** robot into a **real-world-captured 3DGS
> environment**, with correct depth-aware occlusion, so the sim robot looks
> like it's standing in the captured real scene.

That's the genuinely Isaac-flavoured angle for 3DGS compositing: merging sim
physics + RTX rendering with captured reality, rather than patching a
non-photoreal rasteriser.

| Aspect | `mujoco_gs` | `isaac_gs` (this) |
|---|---|---|
| Physics + foreground render | MuJoCo offscreen | **Isaac Sim RTX** |
| Why composite over 3DGS | gain photorealism | place sim robot in a *captured-real* scene |
| Robot | SO-101 (MuJoCo MJCF) | **real Franka Panda USD** (9 DoF) |
| Foreground depth | MuJoCo `render_depth` | Isaac camera `get_depth()` |
| Background renderer | `mujoco_gs.backgrounds` | **reused verbatim** from `mujoco_gs.backgrounds` |
| UI | live Gradio MJPEG | **live Gradio MJPEG (a few fps) + on-demand full-res stills** (RTX isn't real-time-cheap) |

## What's reused vs. new

The background renderers (`GsplatBackground` for real `.ply` / `.spz` captures
— the default — and `PanoramaBackground` for the zero-ML-deps procedural
fallback) are backend-agnostic and **reused verbatim** from
`examples.mujoco_gs.backgrounds` — they only need a
pinhole `CameraParams` (intrinsics + world pose) and numpy. This example
supplies those `CameraParams` from the Isaac RTX camera instead of MuJoCo's
`mj_data`.

| Module | New / reused |
|---|---|
| `camera_utils.py` | **new** — `CameraParams` from the Isaac `Camera` handle (`get_intrinsics_matrix()` / `get_world_pose()`) + `render_rgb_and_depth` via `sim.render()` |
| `compositor.py` | **new** — `IsaacHybridCompositor`: z-composite Isaac RGB+depth over the background (the maths mirrors `mujoco_gs`'s but pulls Isaac frames) |
| `scene.py` | **new** — real Franka USD + red cube + RTX camera |
| `render_demo.py` | **new** — render-stills / clip entry point |
| `backgrounds.py` | **reused** from `examples/mujoco_gs` (imported, not copied) |

## Install + run

```bash
pip install 'strands-robots-sim[isaac]'          # + a working Isaac Sim (RTX GPU)

# Default: the real 3DGS tabletop scene (auto-downloaded + skybox-aligned),
# default Franka. Falls back to the procedural panorama if gsplat isn't
# installed — so this still runs with zero ML deps:
python -m examples.isaac_gs.render_demo --frames 1 --out rollouts/isaac_gs

# Sweep the arm across frames to show it moving on the backdrop:
python -m examples.isaac_gs.render_demo --frames 12 --wave

# Force the procedural panorama background (zero ML deps), or point at your own
# equirectangular panorama image:
python -m examples.isaac_gs.render_demo --panorama /path/to/pano.jpg

# Pick a different built-in 3DGS preset for the background:
python -m examples.isaac_gs.render_demo --gsplat-scene 'tabletop (indoor room)'

# Your own captured 3DGS background (digital-twin use case; needs gsplat + a .ply).
# NOTE: a plain `pip install gsplat` silently disables the CUDA backend in the
# Isaac container (no nvcc) and crashes at first rasterization. Install a
# pre-built wheel matching your torch + CUDA build instead (see requirements.txt):
pip install --index-url https://docs.gsplat.studio/whl/pt24cu118 'gsplat==1.5.3+pt24cu118'
python -m examples.isaac_gs.render_demo --gsplat-ply /path/to/kitchen.ply

# Load a non-default robot (e.g. an MJCF-imported SO-101 USD):
python -m examples.isaac_gs.render_demo --robot-usd /path/to/so101.usd
```

Frames are written as PNGs under the output dir; a grep-stable summary line
(`isaac_gs  frames=N  robot=...  out=...  backend=isaac`) closes the run.

## Browser app (`app.py`)

A Gradio web UI — the browser-accessible companion to the CLI, analogous to
`mujoco_gs/app.py`:

```bash
python -m examples.isaac_gs.app --server-port 7862
# open http://127.0.0.1:7862   (7860/7861 are the mujoco_gs apps)
```

Camera dropdown (oblique / front / topdown presets), a `.ply` background
upload, and **Render** / **Wave + render** buttons. It boots the sim once at
startup and serves a **live MJPEG stream** (`/live`) of the composite at a few
fps for a hands-free view, alongside on-demand full-res stills from the
buttons. Isaac's RTX renderer isn't real-time-cheap like MuJoCo's offscreen
path (and the `SimulationApp` boot is ~200 s), so the stream runs at whatever
rate the render achieves rather than a fixed frame rate. Pick the arm with
`--robot` / `--robot-usd` and the initial view with `--camera`.

**Threading**: Isaac's `SimulationApp` must be created on the main thread (it
installs SIGINT handlers) and its RTX context is thread-affine, but Gradio
serves callbacks on worker threads. So the app inverts control — Isaac owns
the main thread (`boot()` + a `serve_forever()` render loop), Gradio launches
non-blocking (`prevent_thread_lock=True`) in background threads, and render
requests marshal to the main thread via a queue.

## How the composite is built

* **No sim ground plane** (`create_world(ground_plane=False)`): the background
  (3DGS / panorama) *is* the visible floor. A sim ground plane would give
  every pixel finite depth, masking the whole frame as foreground and
  occluding the backdrop everywhere.
* **Explicit lights** (`_add_lighting`): Isaac's default lighting rides with
  the default ground plane we omit, so the scene authors its own distant key
  + dome fill light via `UsdLux` — otherwise the robot renders as an unlit
  black silhouette.
* **Fixed-base Franka + static cube**: with no ground plane, the Franka stays
  up (fixed base) and the cube is `is_static=True` so it doesn't fall through.
* **Depth mask**: a pixel is foreground iff the RTX camera saw finite,
  positive geometry depth there (the robot + cube); everything else shows the
  background. Camera warmup (a few stepped throwaway renders) primes each
  camera's RTX render product so `get_rgba()` returns well-formed frames.

## Runtime dependencies

This example exercises the Phase-2 camera + render wiring on `IsaacSimulation`,
all of which is now on `main`:

| Need | Rides on |
|---|---|
| Camera intrinsics / pose / handle | [PR #61](https://github.com/strands-labs/robots-sim/pull/61) `add_camera` (merged) |
| RGB + metric depth frames | [PR #62](https://github.com/strands-labs/robots-sim/pull/62) `render` (merged) |
| Real Franka articulation | [PR #70](https://github.com/strands-labs/robots-sim/pull/70) `add_robot(usd_path=)` (merged) |

These have all landed on `main`, so `render_demo.py` produces a real
composited frame on a stock build today (see **GPU-validated** below).

## GPU-validated

Target runtime is Isaac Sim 6.0 (`nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:6.0`, Python 3.12,
NVIDIA L4), matching the `isaacsim>=6.0` / `requires-python>=3.12` migration.
The frame below was validated on Isaac Sim 4.5 (`nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:4.5.0`)
against a local integration of #61 + #62 + #70; the library's dual-path
`isaacsim.*` / `omni.isaac.*` imports keep the same code path working on both:

```
Scene built: robot=robot (9 joints), camera=front, objects=['cube']
→ composited frame: 640x480, 13,736 unique colors, gradient backdrop present
  (Franka RTX foreground z-composited over the procedural panorama)
```

(Isaac Sim 4.5 segfaults on its atexit cleanup after the frame is written —
a known Isaac issue, unrelated to this example's correctness.)

## Deliberate scope cuts

* **CLI is render-stills / clip; the browser app adds a live MJPEG view.**
  Isaac's RTX renderer isn't real-time-cheap the way MuJoCo's offscreen
  renderer is, and the `SimulationApp` boot is heavyweight (~200 s). So
  `render_demo.py` stays a render-and-save shape, while `app.py` boots once
  and streams the composite live at whatever rate the RTX render achieves
  (a few fps) plus on-demand full-res stills.
* **DC-term GS color only** (inherited from the reused `GsplatBackground`) — no
  view-dependent spherical-harmonics.
* **No view-dependent background relighting** — the captured 3DGS scene is a
  fixed backdrop; the sim robot is lit by Isaac's RTX scene lights.
