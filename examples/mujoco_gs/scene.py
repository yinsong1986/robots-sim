"""Default scene factory for the MuJoCo-GS example.

Mirrors the canonical MuJoCo-GS-Web scenario: a single small arm at the
origin, a small red cube within reach, a front / topdown / oblique camera
trio, and a ground plane. Pulled out into its own module so the agent and
the Gradio app can share the same setup without duplication.

Robot resolution is environment-dependent. The canonical demo robot is the
SO-101, but its MuJoCo asset does not resolve in every install (the
``robot_descriptions`` → git fallback can fail). So instead of trusting a
single config, :func:`build_default_scene` tries a prioritised list and
verifies that ``add_robot`` actually succeeded — falling back to the SO-100
(the SO-101's direct predecessor, identical 6-DoF kinematics) and then a
Franka Panda. This guarantees the scene always has a real arm, so the agent
never has to "repair" an empty world (which previously caused it to loop
through 20+ tool calls).
