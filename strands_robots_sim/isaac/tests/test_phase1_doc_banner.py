"""Documentation honesty pin: status banner in docs/backends/isaac.md.

The Isaac backend's data plane is mostly wired (validated end-to-end on
``nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:4.5.0`` in PR #74), but two surfaces are
genuinely still no-op: ``replicate`` (fleet replication) and the
articulation-touching paths under ``get_observation`` / ``send_action``
for **procedural** robots (the procedural branch of ``add_robot``
authors USD prims but does not construct an ``Articulation`` handle).
``docs/backends/isaac.md`` discloses this in a ``Status`` banner before
the Installation section, so the disclosure precedes the documented
call sequence rather than appearing after a user would have already
executed the silent no-ops.

This pin enforces three properties of the banner:

1. The banner exists.
2. It precedes the ``## Installation`` heading.
3. It enumerates the affected call surfaces (``add_robot``, ``replicate``,
   ``get_observation``).

Companion pin for the G1 DOF count lives in ``test_procedural_g1_dof.py``;
this file pins only the docs-side concerns.
