"""Documentation honesty pin: Phase 1 status banner in docs/backends/isaac.md.

R2 review on #31 (``simulation.py:627`` thread) asked for a doc note in
``docs/backends/isaac.md``'s Quick Start that the Phase 1 skeleton
silently no-ops the data plane (``add_robot`` on the procedural branch,
``_load_usd_robot``, ``_load_urdf_robot``, ``add_object``, ``add_camera``,
``replicate`` all return ``status: "success"`` without instantiating the
underlying USD prim or articulation handle). Reviewer's "at minimum"
ask: a banner before the Installation section, so the disclosure precedes
the documented call sequence.

Companion pin for the G1 DOF count lives in ``test_procedural_g1_dof.py``
(landed in PR-3 alongside ``procedural.py`` itself). This file pins only
the docs-side concerns.
